This application has a special feature, which I called Sound Vibe, that would make the phone, tablet or any other device used to vibrate for each song in the rhythm of the melody so that people who cannot hear well or at all could feel those vibrations and maybe even dance based on them, if they want this. This functionality would be added as a feature that could be selected on the NowPlaying screen and on the Random screen.  I would love to implement my idea in this application, to add functionalities in it and to make it work one day and I hope that it would be useful for people who cannot hear well or at all. I do not know how it feels to be in that situation but I think that it must be so hard and my application would offer them an option to enjoy in their own way the vibrations of the music that we all, who can hear it, are so blessed to be able to hear and enjoy it as we do.
